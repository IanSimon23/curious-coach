**Implementation methodology for building AI coaching tools that don't create dependency.**

## What This Is

The operational checklist I follow when building AI coaching tools. Based on operational discipline from flight planning systems.

Probably nobody will ever read this, but documenting it forces clarity.

## The Files

- `development-standards.md` - Non-negotiables for each project
- `templates/` - Starting points for new tools

## Why This Exists

Two reasons:

1. **Forces me to think clearly** - If I can't document the process, I don't actually have a process.

2. **Proof for job applications** - Shows I think systematically about AI product development, not just wing it.

## The Philosophy

My philosophy about AI coaching tools lives on my [website and blog](https://www.curiouscoach.tools). This repo is just the implementation mechanics - the checklist that enforces those beliefs.

## Using This

If you're building similar tools:

1. Read `development-standards.md`
2. Copy the templates
3. Adapt to your needs

That's it.

## The Tools Built With This

This methodology has been used to build:

- **[The Writing Gym](https://github.com/IanSimon23/writing-gym)** - Coaches writers through self-assessment
- **[The Jironaut](https://github.com/IanSimon23/jironaut)** - Coaches teams to write better user stories
- **[Other tools](https://github.com/IanSimon23?tab=repositories)** - Each in their own repo

The philosophy is documented on my website. The code is in individual repos. This repo is just the process.
